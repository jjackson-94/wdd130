            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>The purpose of rafting is to find a way to enjoy a sport while also enjoying nature by being immersed into it.
            </p>
            <h3>audience</h3>
            <p>The target audience is easily understood by three simple questions.
                1. Are you looking for a change of pace from everyday life?
                If this is you, look no further than white water rafting! Take time away from the hussle of the world and enjoy nature at its fullest on a raft, and letting worries go down the river. 
                2. Are you looking for more adventures?
                We offer so many options and opportunities for those who are rafting for the first time and those who are looking for more thrill. We have trips that can be booked so that you can enjoy whatever level of thrill you desire. 
                3. Are you looking to spend quality time with your family?
                We have a wide array of trips that are family friendly, even for younger children that are fun and entertaining. Create memories with each other as you go down river in a raft, enjoying views and vistas along the way.
